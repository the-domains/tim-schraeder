Founding Members:

A little under two months ago, our team huddled around a single monitor in the living room of the house we rented for launch week, waiting for the counter on thegrid.io to tick up.

**And then it happened. Our first Founding Member joined.**

And another, and another, and another...

If there's one thing we've learned over the last month and a half, **it's that there's nothing like the feeling of watching that counter go up.** Because it's so much more than just another number. It's a new Founding Member, a future-seeker - someone like you who is ready for The Grid to usher in the next evolution of web design.

**As of this writing, we're up to 11,700+ Founding Members**, and we couldn't have done it without your incredible support. You're telling friends, family, colleagues (and anyone who will listen) about The Grid and we are so grateful.

**We've paid out almost $20,000 in referral credits **($32 for each Founding Member you refer!), and look forward to paying out even more.

Thanks to you, this last month has been filled with some amazing milestones for our team:

* ******We blew past our initial funding goal of $70,000 within the first 24 hours.**
* The Grid has been featured in [Fast Company][0], [Entrepreneur][1], [CNET][2], [Forbes][3], [Wired][4], [VentureBeat][5], and more.
* There were [11,079 submissions][6] to our \#jj Instagram contest this week. We spent a good amount of time on Monday sharing all the incredible images on our team hangout.  
* Our list of investors continues to grow:
  * ******Jerry Yang, Yahoo Founder** with investments in Evernote, Wattpad, and Tango, and mastermind behind the multi-billion dollar deal between Yahoo and e-commerce giant Alibaba.
  * ******Greg Badros, Founder and CEO of Prepared Minds Innovations**, and former Facebook VP of Engineering and Senior Director of Engineering at Google.

And just yesterday, TechCrunch released a new feature article on The Grid - **read more here:**[The Grid Raises $4.6M For Its Intelligent Website Builder][7]

Let's keep the momentum going!
